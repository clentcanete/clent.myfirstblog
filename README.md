            <p class="content">
                The interesting story of computing's evolution spans animals.  Changing the way we work, live, and communicate, computers are evolving over time as tools are developed to find solutions to specific situations or problems. A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically perform a series of arithmetic or logical operations.
Prior to the advancement of technology, we performed fundamental arithmetic calculations using an Abacus. As time went on, we progressed to mechanical tools and beyond. It aids in the development of analytical thinking
Because computing is a process that teaches people how to think to solve problems and how to perceive the world through mechanical or technological tools, it has truly revolutionized human thought.

Being able to compute makes you more quantitative.
I'll give you an example that demonstrates the first computation's major turning points; 
•One of the most basic computing instruments, the abacus, was invented in 2500 BCE. 
•Charles Babbage created the Analytical Engine in 1837; it is regarded as the first mechanical computer. 
•In 1936, Alan Turing proposed the Turing Machine, a theoretical device that served as the basis for contemporary computer science.
Additionally, computers have a positive social influence by fostering provider-consumer contact and collaboration, managing and assisting in improved data and information organization, and having far greater computational and calculating capacity than a typical human.

    OVERVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS
What is IT?
Information technology, or IT, is the utilization of computers, networking, data storage and connected devices, along with the infrastructure and processes involved, to facilitate business or administrative solutions.

Basic concepts of Information Technology 
•Information security -involves all software and hardware implemented to protect the integrity of the organization’s data. Anti-malware protection, firewalls, encryption, authentication and physical security solutions all fall into this category.
•Computer technical support - includes the upkeep of devices within the enterprise environment, including device troubleshooting, repairs, replacements, individual device security, equipment upgrades and infrastructural maintenance.
•Business software development- IT leaders will still be responsible for implementing the software within devices and infrastructure while ensuring the software meets business needs.
•Database and network management - The ability to access and extract information from databases is also included within this category, as well as digital permission settings that allow only authorized users to access individual pieces of data within a database.
HARDWARE- in Information Technology hardware is a the physical aspects of computers, telecommunications and other devices.
SOFTWARE – Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. 
NETWORKING – computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies
THE ROLE OF IT MODERN –IT plays a critical role in managing and analyzing vast amounts of data, enabling businesses to derive valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
